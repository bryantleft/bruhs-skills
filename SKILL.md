# bruhs - Complete Development Lifecycle

When invoked, ask the user which command to run:

```
What do you want to do?
○ spawn - Create new project or add to monorepo
○ claim - Claim existing project for bruhs
○ cook - Plan + Build a feature end-to-end
○ yeet - Ship: Linear ticket → Branch → Commit → PR
○ peep - Address PR review comments and merge
○ dip - Clean up after merge and switch to base branch
```

Present these options interactively, then follow the corresponding command file:
- **spawn** → Read and follow `commands/spawn.md`
- **claim** → Read and follow `commands/claim.md`
- **cook** → Read and follow `commands/cook.md`
- **yeet** → Read and follow `commands/yeet.md`
- **peep** → Read and follow `commands/peep.md`
- **dip** → Read and follow `commands/dip.md`

- `/bruhs cook` or `/bruhs cook <feature>`
